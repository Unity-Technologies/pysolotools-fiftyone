# Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to pysolotools! We are incredibly excited to see how members of our community will use and extend the tools. To facilitate your contributions, we've outlined a brief set of guidelines to ensure that your extensions can be easily integrated.

## Communication

First, please read through our
[code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md),
as we expect all our contributors to follow it.

Second, before starting on a project that you intend to contribute to the Perception package we **strongly** recommend posting on our [Issues page](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/pysolotools/issues) and briefly outlining the changes you plan to make. This will enable us to provide
some context that may be helpful for you, including advice on how to optimally perform your changes or even reasons for not doing it.

Lastly, if you're looking for input on what to contribute, feel free to browse the [Unity Computer Vision forums](https://forum.unity.com/forums/computer-vision.626/) and GitHub issues with the `Requests` or `Bug` label.

## Git Branches

The `main` branch corresponds to the most recent version of the project.

When contributing to the project, please make sure that your Pull Request (PR)
contains the following:

- Detailed description of the changes performed
- Corresponding changes to documentation and unit tests
- Summary of the tests performed to validate your changes
- Issue numbers that the PR resolves (if any)

## Continuous Integration (CI)

We run continuous integration on all PRs; all tests must be passing before the PR is merged.

## Contributor License Agreements

When you open a pull request, one GitHub check will require you to acknolwedge our Contributor
License Agreement. We allow both individual contributions and contributions made
on behalf of companies. We use an open source tool called CLA assistant. If you
have any questions on our CLA, please
[submit an issue](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/pysolotools/issues) or
