## Introduction

pysolotools-fiftyone is a python package for viewing and interacting with solo datasets using the [Voxel51](https://voxel51.com/) viewer.

This package allows the user to create a new Voxel51 viewer in either a web browser or jupyter notebook.

SOLO datasets are generated by Unity's Computer Vision offering [Perception](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/perception). Please see [here](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/perception/blob/main/com.unity.perception/com.unity.perception/Documentation~/Schema/SoloSchema.md) for more information about the SOLO schema.

It supports the displaying of the following annotations:
- Bounding Boxes
- 3D Bounding Boxes
- Keypoints
- Instance Segmentation
- Semantic Segmentation
- Depth
- Occlusion

## Pre-Requisites
